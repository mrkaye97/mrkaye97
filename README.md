### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm **Matt**

I'm a data scientist at CollegeVine working on bringing free, data-driven college guidance to families. 

In my free time, you can find me cooking, reading, skiing, and committing to open-source. 

Sometimes I [write about statistics, data science, or other miscellaneous things](https://matthewrkaye.com/posts.html).
